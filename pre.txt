Here is the **complete, consolidated list** of every application and tool needed for your Niri setup to work seamlessly on Fedora.

I have matched the "Command Name" (what you use in the config) with the actual "Fedora Package Name" so you can install them easily.

### 📦 The Master Install Command

Run this single command to install everything at once.

*Note: I swapped `satty` for `swappy` (easier on Fedora) and `swaylock-effects` for standard `swaylock` to ensure this command works out of the box.*

```bash
sudo dnf install niri waybar swaync fuzzel alacritty \
swaybg swayidle swaylock grim slurp wl-clipboard \
wf-recorder cliphist libnotify wireplumber \
playerctl brightnessctl jq swappy \
network-manager-applet blueman

```

### 📋 Detailed App Breakdown

#### 1. Core Desktop & Window Management

These are the essentials that make the graphical environment work.

* **`niri`**: The Window Manager (Compositor).
* **`waybar`**: The status bar at the bottom.
* **`swaync`**: The Notification Center (slide-out panel).
* **`fuzzel`**: The App Launcher (Menu).
* **`alacritty`**: The Terminal Emulator.

#### 2. Visuals & System Daemons

Background processes that handle the look and feel.

* **`swaybg`**: Sets the wallpaper.
* **`swayidle`**: Detects inactivity (to turn off screens).
* **`swaylock`**: Locks the screen securely.
* *(Note: Your config used `swaylock-effects` for blur/fade. This is not in standard Fedora repos. Use standard `swaylock` or install the effects version from a COPR repo).*


* **`cliphist`**: Records clipboard history.
* **`wl-clipboard`**: Required for copy/paste to work in Wayland.

#### 3. Screenshots & Recording

Tools for capturing content.

* **`grim`**: Takes the screenshot.
* **`slurp`**: Selects the region on the screen.
* **`swappy`**: Edits the screenshot (arrows, text, crop).
* *(Alternative: `satty` - requires manual install via Cargo/Rust).*


* **`wf-recorder`**: Records screen video to MP4.

#### 4. Connectivity (Tray Icons)

The applets required for the icons in the bottom-right of your bar.

* **`nm-applet`** (Package: `network-manager-applet`): The WiFi/Network icon and menu.
* **`blueman-applet`** (Package: `blueman`): The Bluetooth icon and manager.

#### 5. Audio & Utilities

Helpers for scripts and hardware control.

* **`libnotify`** (Command: `notify-send`): Sends the popup bubbles for alerts.
* **`wireplumber`** (Command: `wpctl`): Controls volume and audio devices.
* **`playerctl`**: Controls media (Play/Pause/Next) for Spotify/YouTube.
* **`brightnessctl`**: Controls laptop screen brightness.
* **`jq`**: A tool for processing JSON data (needed for your custom Waybar scripts).
* **`JetBrainsMono Nerd Font`**: The font required to see the icons (usually installed via `dnf install jetbrains-mono-fonts-all` or manually).

### Next Step

Would you like me to write a **startup script** that checks if all these are running and relaunches them if they crash, to make your system bulletproof?
